# Gesture Recognizers
Touch/pointer gesture recognizer scripts based on [EventSystems handlers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/SupportedEvents.html).

Gesture recognizers can be used in uGUI-based UIs, as well as physics objects if your Camera has `PhysicsRaycaster` or `Physics2DRaycaster`.

Implemented gestures:
- Tap (configurable number of touches and taps)
- Long press (configurable number of touches and press duration)
- Pan (configurable number of touches)
- Pinch (configurable number of touches, at least 2)
